                                The European languages are members of the same family. Their
                                separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc,
                                Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in
                                their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common
                                words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be
                                desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.

                        will be located in the suburbs, not far from it there will be
                        picturesque forests, fields, lakes and quarries where you can
                        arrange a photo shoot or horseback riding. We will teach horseback
                        riding for everyone, regardless of experience. Our students will
                        participate in dressage and show jumping competitions. It will
                        also be possible to organize a photo session with us - with our or
                        your photographer. All our horses will be calm and able, and our
                        photographer will have many years of experience working with
                        animals. In addition to everything else, if you are too afraid and
                        just want to find out “what is a horse?”, You can just come to us
                        and treat the horses with carrots or apples, they love it very
                        much.</span>
